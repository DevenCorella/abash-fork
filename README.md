PRE-REQUISITES:
In order for ABash to work you will need the following:
 - Keneanung's eventBus package: https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-event-bus/EventBus.nxs
 - Argwin's eventBus events package:
 - And the ABash package:
 
They MUST be in that order in your Reflex Packages screen in Achaea.

If you are interested in helping develop the ABash package, make a fork of the basher.js file in your own github account, make the changes, and create a pull request
so I can review it and merge it into the file. You will not see the update for 1 to 2 days because of how the CDN updates.

If you absolutely must see your update immediately, let me know and I can send you the commit ID and instructions on how to use it.

Argwin
